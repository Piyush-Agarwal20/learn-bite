# LearnBite - Complete App Overview

## What is LearnBite?

**LearnBite** is a mobile-first progressive web application (PWA) designed for **bite-sized learning**. It helps users learn complex topics through short, focused lessons that can be completed in 5-15 minutes. The app makes learning accessible, trackable, and engaging.

### Core Concept
