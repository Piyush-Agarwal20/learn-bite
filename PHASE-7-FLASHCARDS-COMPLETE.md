# Phase 7: Flashcards System - COMPLETED âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Setup
- âœ… Created 9 sample flashcards for 3 Python lessons
- âœ… Flashcards table structure verified (id, lesson_id, front_text, back_text)

### 2. API Layer
- âœ… Created `src/services/api/flashcards.ts` with:
  - `getFlashcardsByLessonId()` - Fetch all flashcards for a lesson
  - `getFlashcardById()` - Fetch single flashcard
- âœ… Exported flashcards API functions in main API index

### 3. UI Component
- âœ… Created `src/pages/Flashcards.tsx` with:
  - Card flip functionality (tap to reveal answer)
  - Progress dots showing position in deck
  - Previous/Next navigation buttons
  - Restart functionality when reaching the end
  - Responsive design matching app theme
  - Loading and error states
  - Empty state for lessons without flashcards

### 4. Navigation & Routing
- âœ… Added `/flashcards/:lessonId` route in App.tsx
- âœ… Added "Practice with Flashcards" button in LessonView page
- âœ… Exported Flashcards component in pages index

## Features

### Simple & Intuitive
- Tap anywhere on card to flip between question and answer
- Clear visual indication of current card position
- Easy navigation with Previous/Next buttons
- Restart option when finished

### User Experience
- Progress dots show how many cards completed
- Cards display front text (question) and back text (answer)
- Fixed controls at bottom above navigation bar
- Smooth transitions and interactions

## Sample Flashcards Created

**Introduction to Python (3 cards):**
1. What is Python? â†’ High-level, interpreted programming language...
2. Who created Python? â†’ Guido van Rossum in 1991
3. What are Python's main features? â†’ Easy to learn, readable syntax...

**Variables and Data Types (3 cards):**
1. What is a variable? â†’ Container for storing data values...
2. Name basic data types â†’ int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict
3. How do you create a variable? â†’ x = 10 or name = "John"

**Functions and Parameters (3 cards):**
1. What is a function? â†’ Reusable block of code...
2. How to define a function? â†’ Use def keyword
3. What are parameters? â†’ Variables in function definition...

## How to Use

1. **Access from Lesson:**
   - Go to any lesson (e.g., Topics â†’ Python Programming â†’ Introduction to Python)
   - Scroll to bottom and click "ðŸ“š Practice with Flashcards"

2. **Navigate Flashcards:**
   - Tap card to flip between question and answer
   - Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate
   - Watch progress dots to track position
   - Click Restart when finished to review again

3. **URL Pattern:**
   - `/flashcards/:lessonId` - Direct access by lesson ID

## Technical Details

### File Structure:
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ flashcards.ts          (API service)
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Flashcards.tsx          (Main component)
â””â”€â”€ App.tsx                     (Route added)
```

### Database Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM flashcards
WHERE lesson_id = 'xxx'
ORDER BY created_at ASC
```

### State Management:
- `currentIndex` - Tracks which card is shown
- `isFlipped` - Boolean for card flip state
- `flashcards` - Array of all cards for lesson
- `loading` - Loading state
- `error` - Error handling

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

Could add later if needed:
- Swipe gestures for mobile
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- "Know it" / "Study more" tracking
- Shuffle cards option
- Favorite/bookmark cards
- Progress tracking per flashcard set

## Testing Checklist

âœ… Server running on http://localhost:5173/
âœ… No compilation errors
âœ… Route added successfully
âœ… API functions working
âœ… Sample data in database
âœ… UI component created with all features

## Summary

Phase 7 (Flashcards System) is **complete and ready to test**!

The implementation is simple, clean, and follows the existing app patterns. Users can now practice lessons with flashcards directly from any lesson page.
